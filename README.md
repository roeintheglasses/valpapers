## Features

|      | Feature       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ‚öôÔ∏è | Architecture  | The system follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, separating the concerns of data manipulation, presentation, and user interaction.                                                  |
| üìÑ   | Documentation | The codebase lacks comprehensive documentation, making it challenging for new developers to understand and contribute to the project effectively.                                                            |
| üîó   | Dependencies  | The project uses external libraries like Express.js, Mongoose, and Passport.js for server-side functionality and authentication.                                                                             |
| üß©   | Modularity    | The system employs modularity by organizing its functionalities into different directories, such as models, routes, and views, promoting code reusability.                                                   |
| üß™   | Testing       | The codebase has limited testing coverage, mainly focusing on unit tests using frameworks like Mocha and Chai for some routes and models.                                                                    |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è | Performance   | The system's performance depends on factors like server infrastructure and database optimization, but there are no specific performance optimizations implemented in the codebase.                           |
| üîê   | Security      | The project uses Passport.js for authentication, which provides session management and encryption of user credentials, enhancing security. Some security best practices, like input validation, are present. |

Note: Please note that this analysis is based on a cursory review of the codebase provided and may not reflect every aspect or detail of the project. A more thorough analysis would require a deeper dive into the codebase and discussions with the development team.
